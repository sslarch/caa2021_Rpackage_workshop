## Git

**https://r-pkgs.org/git.html**

Git is a version control system that documents all changes to files in a directory

- Documentation of all steps in the development process
- Browsing and rolling back to old stages
- Safe collaboration on the same files

```r
?usethis::use_git()
```

## Github

**https://github.com**

Github is an online platform to store, publish and manage Git projects

- Free and easy "backup" and publication
- Low lock-in, because based on git
- Manage collaborative working: Issues, Pull Requests
- Well implemented interaction with many coding web services
- Social media features: A community of coding archaeologists

```r
?usethis::use_github()
```

## Vignettes

**https://r-pkgs.org/vignettes.html**

Vignettes are a special part of the R package documentation, that explains the workflows a package supports

```r
browseVignettes()
vignette(topic = "introduction", package = "cowplot")
```

- Free form: Tutorial/Blog post/Book chapter/Paper
- Less technical, more focussed on applications and usecases
- Usually written in Rmarkdown

```r
?usethis::use_vignette()
```

## Unit testing

**https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html**

A unit test is test code to check if a function returns what you expect given a certain input

- Guarantee correctness of complex functions by testing them and their smaller parts
- Facilitates refactoring and prevents you from accidentally breaking things
- Test code serves as a concrete example for how your functions can be used

```r
?usethis::use_testthat()
```

## CI

**https://github.com/r-lib/actions**

Continous integration means automatic testing and checking of code changes. Multiple companies offer free web services for open source projects (Travis-CI, Gitlab, Github)

- Each change to your project triggers a full test
- Clean, virtual environments and multiple OS
- Not just for testing, but also for any other operations (e.g. deploying a static website)
- Should be used sparingly to save energy

```r
?usethis::use_github_action
```
