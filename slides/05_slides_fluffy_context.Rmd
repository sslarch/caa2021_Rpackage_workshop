## Licenses

- There are many options and differences under various legal systems, in general, you want your code to be accessible...
- What if I do not specify an **open source** license?

[https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/) helps you with choosing a license...

- Most common options for software:

    - **MIT License**: simple & permissive
        
        *"Do whatever you want with my stuff."*
        
    - **GNU GPLv3**: *copyleft* license
    
        *"Do whatever you want, but always show the source code."*

\scriptsize        
- What about the `CC-BY-Licenses`?

    - \scriptsize These are licenses for the data (etc.), `CC-BY-4.0` and `CC-BY-SA-4.0` should not be used for software.
    
        [https://creativecommons.org/choose/](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)

## Creating a license

- License lives in the `LICENSE` file
- It is specified in a proper field in the `DESCRIPTION`

`usethis::use_*_license()` helper function:

- `usethis::use_mit_license("First Last")`

    to use MIT License
    
- `usethis::use_gpl3_license()`

    to use GNU GPL v3

# Citations

## Citations

> `We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it when using it for data analysis.`

- Citing packages employed in your analysis is a good practice 
(as well as citing books, articles and other sources you use...)

- `R` makes this super easy!

`citation()` returns citation for `R`

`citation(package = "pckgname")` returns citation for a package

\footnotesize
sometimes, there are several items you can cite and no BiBTeX, wrap the `citation()` call into `toBibtex()` function: `toBibtex(citation(package = "spatstat"))`

## Citing `R`

\footnotesize

```
> citation()

To cite R in publications use:

  R Core Team (2021). R: A language and environment (...) 
  R Foundation for  Statistical Computing, Vienna, (...)
  URL https://www.R-project.org/.

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

  @Manual{,
    title = {R: A Language and Environment (...)},
    author = {{R Core Team}},
    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical (...)},
    (...)
  }
```

## Adding a citation to your package

- if you do not add it yourself, it is generated from `DESCRIPTION`
- lives in a file `inst/CITATION`

**`usethis::use_citation()`** creates the file for you:

\scriptsize
```
citHeader("To cite myAMAZINGpackage in publications use:")
citEntry(
  entry    = "Article",
  title    = "myAMAZINGpacakge",
  author   = as.person("first last"),
  journal  = "Amazing packages journal",
  year     = "2021",
  volume   = "4",
  number   = "2",
  pages    = "42-69",
  url      = "www.myAMAZINGwebsite.org",
  textVersion = paste(
    "First, Last 2021: myAMAZINGpackage. Amazing packages journal
    4(2), 42-69. www.myAMAZINGwebsite.org"))
```

# Wrap up and exercise

## Exercise I

### License

1. Explore the `DESCRIPTION` file, what does it say about the license?
2. Add MIT License with your name to your package.
3. Explore the `DESCRIPTION`, `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md` files

## Exercise II

### Citations

1. Load your package

    (`devtools::load_all()` or `Ctrl+Shift+L` in `Rstudio`)
    
2. See the default citation `citation("pckgname")`

3. Let's edit the citation!

4. Use `usethis::use_citation()` to generate a `CITATION` file

5. Fill in the gaps!

6. Load the package.

7. Inspect the citation.

8. Repeat until:
    
    1. You get no error messages and/or
    2. It is perfect...
